  <p class="blog-subheader">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you 
    made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</p> 
    <p class="blog-body"> An ethical decision I have had 
    to make recently was to provide an alternative platform for people to listen to my music. 
    Recently news broke that the ceo of the largest music streaming company Spotify was 
    using the millions earned off of the artists on the platform to invest in Ai drone 
    research to be used in warfare. After a great deal of public outcry many musicians 
    are considering alternative platforms to host and release thier music with some removing 
    their music from the platform entirely. While I have a very small audience and do not 
    believe that my personal catalogue is generating much if any money that could be spent 
    on warmongering and things my values do not align with whatsoever, I did want to provide 
    the people within my community who do engage with my music an alternative cost free way 
    to download and listen. I made a small html website that hosts a link to a file where anyone 
    can download all of my released music for free, as well as a small version of a streaming 
    site for the songs so people can listen online. It is important to me that music and art 
    can be free and accessible for everyone and being in control of my own method of providing 
    that seemed like the best choice.</p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </p>
    <p class="blog-body">I have been deeply influenced by local art collectives and communities in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, the way in which people come together to make events and collaborative projects happen has shaped what I think is possible with limited resources. </p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. </p>
    <p class="blog-body">I am a persistent learner, I am able to self manage my time and learning well and I am a clear communicator in group settings. I think my ability to work well with others will be very valuable in this learning journey, especially given the often collaborative nature of coding and software development. </p>
    <p class="blog-subheader"> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</p>
    <p class="blog-body"> I can struggle with engaging with topics that I dont have a personal interest in which can be detrimental to my learning when not kept in check. </p>
