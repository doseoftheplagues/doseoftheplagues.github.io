  <p class="blog-subheader">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p> 
  <p class="blog-body">I would like to work in software development in some form, ideally something more focused on front end UI and Ux development as that is what calls me the most in coding. I enjoy making things with consideration as to how they will be interacted with and I enjoy a lot of the more design focused parts of coding. Ideally I would establish a balance where some income comes from software development and some comes from my other interests (music production, live performance, building instruments etc).</p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p> 
  <p class="blog-body">I think my learning strengths are that I am persistent when it comes to overcoming challenges, I have a wide range of interests and experience with different technologies and fields and I also have a wide range of experience working with people in group settings and the organising, creating and interacting that comes with those groups. I think my biggest limitation can be my confidence. I tend towards comparison with others and often when I am falling short of my own expectations I can spiral a little. I also think often I take on workloads larger than I can handle and end up having to make up the difference in my own time.</p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p> 
  <p class="blog-body"> I would like to fully dedicate myself to the learning and I would especially like to develop my ability to efficiently self manage my time. While I think I have been reasonable at this previously I have been thinking that I would really like to take the chance to improve myself in that regard. </p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</p> 
  <p class="blog-body">I will appropriately manage time, communicate clearly to facilitators and peers and treat others' opinions and input with appropriate value.</p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p> 
  <p class="blog-body">If things get the better of me I will reach out for necessary help, communicate my  issues clearly and try to prioritise tasks calmly and methodically until I am able to complete them. I will take any necessary breaks to care for myself and clarify my thinking on given issues.</p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p> 
  <p class="blog-body">I have both peers and facilitators available for me to reach out to in the dev academy discord and homegroup, as well as specific help channels. I am confident in my ability to reach out through those channels when I need assistance. </p>
    <p class="blog-subheader">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p> 
  <p class="blog-body"> I expect them to be available if I have questions and to give clear instructions and timelines for assessments as well as constructive feedback .</p>
  <p class="blog-subheader">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</p> 
  <p class="blog-body">I currently have no scheduling conflicts that occur within school hours.</p>
